            I’m a developer passionate about creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.
            My strengths lie in designing maintainable systems, collaborating with teams, and crafting
            solutions that align with user and client needs. With a strong foundation in engineering
            principles and a continuous desire to learn, I thrive in roles that combine problem-solving
            with thoughtful development practices.

            I’m currently available for freelance work! Whether you need a custom website, help optimizing
            your existing system, or technical consultancy to decide on the best solutions for your project,
            I’d love to hear from you. I offer free initial consultations to understand your needs and provide
            tailored advice, drawing from my extensive experience in both start-ups and agencies.
        </p>

            I’ve spent over six years building scalable applications and leading engineering projects.
            Most recently at a <a>fintech startup</a> Substantive Research, I implemented CI/CD pipelines,
            introduced testing strategies, and supported junior developers while ensuring secure coding
            practices. Before that, I worked at a small <a>digital agency & consultancy</a>, specialising in the
            property industry, where I developed enterprise systems using PHP, Symfony, and
            Vue and acted as a part-time Scrum Master to enhance team productivity.
        </p>

            Outside of work, I love snowboarding wherever there’s fresh powder, playing and
            watching football, bouldering and traveling. I like learning about new cultures and languages -
            I’m reasonably fluent in Spanish and currently learning Japanese.
